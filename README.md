# Minimalistic React template

This is a template to build react applications. 

This template is highly inspired to this [FrontendMasters course on react](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v5/) by [Brian Holt](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/brian-holt/).

The course material is also available for free as an open source project [here](https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-react-v5/) and [here](https://github.com/btholt/complete-intro-to-react-v5).

If you want to learn react that is a really good starting point. 

## Why I decided to create this template

There are two reasons of being for this template:
 - I wanted to consolidate the knowledge gained by the aforementioned and to have a ready to go and resusable template for react projects
 - I do not like complexity and I think that one of the purpose of the software engineering should be lowering complexity. So, I needed something simpler and clearer than the [create react app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) project. Create react app is a wonderful project, but I was looking for something simpler and little less magical.
 
## How the template is organized

This template includes the following tools:
 - [prettier](https://prettier.io/) to ensure a consistent code formatting style
 - [eslint](https://eslint.org/) to ensure the code quality
 - [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) which is used to transpile the code and to bundle it for development and production
 - [babel](https://babeljs.io/) which is used to control how parcel is going to transpile the source code
 
 The preferred editor to use this template is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following extensions installed:
  - [prettier extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) so that prettier can format the code automatically on save
  - [eslint extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) so that eslint can check the code automatically and highlight all the detected code problems in visual studio code
